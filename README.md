This project can generate playlists full of randomly picked songs which all can match a certain environment or condition which the user requests.
The code has access to a Spotify dataset with around 20,500 songs which all have rankings in numerical categories such as danceability, energy, or valence.
If you wanted a playlist for a party, for example, the code will randomly select songs with a high danceability and energy ranking.
You can also randomly generate a playlist suited for studying, which will randomly select songs with low-mid valence, energy, and speechiness ranking.
You can even generate a playlist for crying(we've all been there), and it will select songs which have a low valence score.
